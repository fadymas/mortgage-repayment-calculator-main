## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Css library
- [React](https://react.dev/) – for building UI components
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – as a build tool

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to work with React by creating small reusable components (components architecture), keeping them pure so they always return the same result for the same input (pure functions), passing data with props (props), and managing changes with useState (state). I also used useEffect (side effects) to fetch and show the data when the component loads. In addition, I practiced conditional rendering (conditional render) to display loading states and skeletons before the data is ready.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Helped me understand how to use responsive utility classes and how to apply spacing, typography, and custom colors effectively.

- [React documentation – “Learn React”](https://react.dev/learn) – The official React guide that introduces key concepts.
