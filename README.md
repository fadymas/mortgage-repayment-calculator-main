# Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) – CSS library
- [React](https://react.dev/) – for building UI components
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – as a build tool
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) – for accessible and customizable UI components built on top of Radix UI
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – for static type checking and cleaner, more reliable code
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) – for handling form inputs and validation efficiently
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) – for schema-based validation integrated with React Hook Form

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to work with **React** by creating small reusable components (component architecture), keeping them pure so they always return the same result for the same input, passing data using **props**, and managing changes using **useState** (state).

I also learned how to use **React Hook Form** to handle form inputs and validation in a more optimized and clean way — avoiding unnecessary re-renders and keeping the form logic organized.

Additionally, I learned how to integrate **Zod** with React Hook Form to create strong and type-safe validation schemas, making form validation easier to maintain and ensuring accurate error messages.

I also learned how to use **TypeScript** in React projects — defining interfaces for props, adding types to states and functions, and improving overall code safety and readability.

Finally, I worked with **shadcn/ui** to quickly design accessible and modern UI components that match the project’s design requirements, customizing them easily using Tailwind CSS classes.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Helped me understand how to use responsive utility classes and apply spacing, typography, and custom colors effectively.
- [React documentation – “Learn React”](https://react.dev/learn) – The official React guide that introduces key concepts.
- [React Hook Form Docs](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) – A great resource to understand how to register inputs, manage errors, and optimize form performance.
- [Zod Documentation](https://zod.dev/?id=basic-usage) – Helped me learn how to define and integrate validation schemas easily with React Hook Form.
- [TypeScript for React Developers](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/) – Helped me understand how to apply TypeScript to React components effectively.
- [shadcn/ui Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) – Taught me how to use prebuilt, accessible components and customize them using Tailwind CSS.
